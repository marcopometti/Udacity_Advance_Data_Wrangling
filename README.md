Data Usage:
The primary goal of my analysis is to identify the three counties in Washington State with the highest number of electric vehicles. 
Once these counties are identified, my aim is to determine the top five car manufacturers present in these areas. 
The focus will then shift to understanding which of these manufacturers is the most prevalent in each of the three counties. 
This will allow me to gain a better understanding of the electric vehicle market distribution in these key regions.
